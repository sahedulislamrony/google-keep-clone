**Privacy Policy**

_Last updated: October 7, 2024_

This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and shared when you use this application ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this policy.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We collect the following types of information:

- **Personal Information**: When you sign in using third-party authentication providers such as Google, Facebook, GitHub, or Twitter, we may collect your email address, profile information (such as name and profile photo), and a unique user ID.
- **Usage Data**: The App may collect non-personal information about your usage patterns, such as log data (IP address, browser type, device information, and access times).
- **Notes and User Data**: Any notes or data you create or store within the App are stored in Firebase Realtime Database, which is private and accessible only to you unless you decide to share it.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Your information is used to:

- Provide and maintain the App's functionality.
- Authenticate and authorize you using Firebase Authentication with Google, Facebook, GitHub, and Twitter.
- Store and retrieve your notes or data securely using Firebase Realtime Database.
- Improve the App's features and user experience.
- Notify you about updates, security alerts, and other administrative information.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not sell or trade your personal information. However, we may share your information in the following cases:

- **Service Providers**: We use third-party services like Firebase, which handle authentication and data storage. These services have access to your data solely to perform tasks on our behalf.
- **Legal Compliance**: We may share your information if required by law or in response to legal processes.

## 4. Data Security

We take precautions to secure your personal data. All user data is stored securely in Firebase with encryption both in transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
